        <h1>ES6 Course on udemy</h1>
        <p>
            Taking a es6 Course on Udemy to get more familiar with the language and start implementing it in my code.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <p>
                My Notes on different things in this course:
            </p>
            <ul>Helper Methods:
                <p>Array Helpers allow to eliminate the use of the for loop</p>
                <li>Why not for loop?
                    <p>There are many parts that can be mistyped in a for loop and mess up the whole iteration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>forEach:
                    <p> use the array you currently have. The call the helper method (forEach). The iterator function is an anoyomus function.
                        The parameter is the singular version of the array because it it each individual element in the array.
                        You can call it whatever you want but more specific names help for readability.The function is called
                        once for every element in the array</p>
                        <p>forEach and for loop do the exact same thing. The reason you use a forEach is because it is a lot less code to right so a lot less from for errors and makes debugging slightly easier. The logic needed to write the forEach is much less in terms of setting up</p>
                        <p>Elements are iterated and are passed as arguments</p>
                        <p>An anonymous function does not have to be included in the array. You can pull that function out and just call it in the forEach method</p>
                        <p>When shoudld you use a forEach?</p>
                        <p>When you are deleting your emails. emails.forEach(function(email{
                        deleteEmail(email);    
                        }));</p>
                        <p>For each is better in this case because of the less code you write.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Map Helper Method
                    <p>Most used loop</p>
                    <p>You must return a value or else it will return undefined</p>
                    <p>You can "pluck" things out of an object literal</p>
                    <p>Real life case for using map. Rendering list of data. Something like FB with post.
                        Load data from backend which will probably be an array of objects. 
                        You can use map. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Do not mutate the original update. You will just map through and store it in a different variable</p>
                </li>
                <li>Filter method - filtering of a list.
<p>Filtering of a list</p>
<p>Practical use case is clicking the checkbox for searching specific things</p>
<p>You must have a return statement. Else you will have an empty array</p>
<p></p>               
</li>

<li>Find Helper
    <p>Search through array and look for a specific element. </p>
<p>Draw back of using find. It iterates until it finds the first element
    
</p>
</li>
<li>
    Every Helper
    <p>Every works with the && operator</p>
    <p>Looks at all the values</p>
    <p>practical - if there is a login. before info is sent to the server. </p>
</li>

            </ul>

        </ul>
